# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices
The dataset used for this project is the Ames Housing dataset that was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It is an alternative to the popular but older Boston Housing dataset.

The Ames Housing dataset is also used in the Advanced Regression Techniques challenge on the Kaggle Website. These competitions is a great way to improve my skills and measure my progress as a data scientist.

Kaggle describes the competition as follows:

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the

In this projet we will:
Continue iteration on feature engineering:
Reserach some other approaches to feature engineering online around housing data.
Visit the Kaggle kernels page for this dataset to see approaches others took.
Improve your feature selection:
Research ways of doing feature selection better with categorical columns (something we didn't cover in this particular course).
