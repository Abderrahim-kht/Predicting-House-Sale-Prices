# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices
In this projet we will:
Continue iteration on feature engineering:
Reserach some other approaches to feature engineering online around housing data.
Visit the Kaggle kernels page for this dataset to see approaches others took.
Improve your feature selection:
Research ways of doing feature selection better with categorical columns (something we didn't cover in this particular course).
